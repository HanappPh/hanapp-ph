# 🚀 Pre-Push Hook Options for HanApp-PH

## Current Configuration (Comprehensive)

Your current pre-push hook runs:

- `npm run test:affected` - Tests only changed projects
- `npm run lint:affected` - Linting only changed projects
- `npm run typecheck:affected` - TypeScript checking only changed projects
- `npm run build:affected` - Production build only changed projects

## Alternative Configurations

### 1. 🔥 Full Production Ready (Recommended for Startup)

```bash
echo "Running comprehensive pre-push checks..."
npm run test:affected
npm run lint:affected
npm run typecheck:affected
npm run build:affected:prod
echo "✅ All checks passed - ready for production!"
```

### 2. ⚡ Fast Development (Good for rapid iteration)

```bash
echo "Running essential pre-push checks..."
npm run lint:affected
npm run typecheck:affected
echo "✅ Code quality checks passed!"
```

### 3. 🛡️ Maximum Safety (For critical releases)

```bash
echo "Running maximum safety checks..."
npm run test:all
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build:prod
echo "✅ Full codebase verified!"
```

### 4. 🎯 Custom Startup Balance (Recommended)

```bash
echo "Running startup-optimized checks..."
npm run test:affected
npm run lint:affected
npm run typecheck:affected
npm run build:affected
npm run e2e:affected || echo "⚠️  E2E tests failed but continuing..."
echo "✅ Startup checks complete!"
```

## Benefits of Production Build in Pre-Push

✅ **Catches build errors before deployment**
✅ **Verifies all imports and dependencies work**
✅ **Ensures production optimizations don't break functionality**
✅ **Validates environment-specific configurations**
✅ **Prevents broken deployments to staging/production**

## Performance Considerations

- **Affected builds**: Only builds changed projects (~30s-2min)
- **Full builds**: Builds everything (~2-5min)
- **Skip for hotfixes**: You can use `git push --no-verify` to skip hooks in emergencies

## Recommendations by Development Stage

### Early Stage (Now):

- Use affected builds (current setup)
- Focus on code quality + basic functionality

### Growth Stage (Team of 3-5):

- Add e2e tests to pre-push
- Use production configuration builds
- Consider parallel execution

### Scale Stage (Team of 5+):

- Move comprehensive checks to CI/CD
- Keep pre-push fast but essential
- Use deployment pipelines for full verification

## Current Timing Estimate

With your current setup, expect:

- Tests: 10-30 seconds
- Linting: 5-15 seconds
- TypeCheck: 5-15 seconds
- Build: 30-90 seconds
- **Total: ~1-3 minutes** (only for changed projects)
